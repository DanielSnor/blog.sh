# Changelog

Every released version, newest first, so a clone can answer "what changed?"
without going to GitHub. Each entry says what was wrong and what it meant in
practice -- a one-line "fixed a bug" is no use to someone deciding whether an
upgrade is urgent for them.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`: a patch release fixes defects and never
changes configuration, content or the shape of a post file; a minor release
adds features and stays compatible with existing sites. `./blog.sh version`
prints what an installation is running.

## 1.1 -- unreleased

Four things a site can now do that it couldn't, and one class of defect
removed from the deploy. Nothing to migrate: `git pull`, rebuild, deploy.
Two changes are worth knowing about before you upgrade, both at the bottom.

### New

- **A post can be pinned to the front page.** `pinned: true` in a
  published post's header holds a copy at the top of the first listing
  page -- only there, because a pin is a statement about the front page,
  not about the archive: type and tag listings, the feeds and the sitemap
  stay chronological. Once the post has aged onto page 2 it appears both
  at the top of page 1 and in its own place on page 2; while it is still
  on page 1 it appears exactly once. Anchored pagination is untouched, so
  toggling a pin costs one or two files in a deploy. The pinned copy
  carries a small mark in the corner of its date badge, using the same
  neutral colour pair the badge already inverts to on hover.
- **Publishing slots turn `[s]` into a queue.** `publishing.slots: ["mon
  09:30", "wed 09:30", "fri 09:30"]` (or a single `"daily 09:00"`) says
  when posts usually go out, and scheduling then offers the next slot no
  other scheduled post occupies -- three drafts written in one evening go
  out on three consecutive slots instead of together. It only ever
  suggests: typing a date overrides it, a post hand-scheduled for 14:17
  blocks nobody, and nothing ever moves a post that already has a time.
  Without the key, the prompt is the one that was there before. The offer
  names the slots it walked past and who holds them, and a scheduled
  draft's properties print the whole queue -- an offer of Sunday on a site
  with a Saturday slot otherwise reads as a queue that skips Saturdays,
  when the truth is that Saturday was taken.
- **Posts can carry files.** A line that is nothing but
  `[label](handbook.pdf)` with a bare filename is an attachment, the same
  way a bare filename in an image line is a photo -- staged through
  `incoming/`, stored with the post, rendered as a card with the label,
  the extension and the size, because a download deserves to say what it
  costs first. A URL stays a link, and only whitelisted extensions count.
  A short line plus a file makes a *document* post, and DOCUMENTS appears
  in the nav once the first one exists.
- **One dialog for a post's properties and actions.** `./blog.sh props
  <slug>` (in the wizard: pick a post, then `v`) shows a post's state,
  type, tags, pin and announcement in one place, and offers the guarded
  actions -- publish or schedule for a draft; unpublish, (re-)announce,
  pin/unpin and delete for a published post. Type and tags stay editable
  where they always were, in the frontmatter of `edit`, prefilled with
  their current values; the pin, being a switch rather than a value,
  toggles right in the dialog with `[c]` (the header line keeps working
  too), and the pinned post is marked `[PINNED]` in every list and
  picker. The wizard menu shrank to five activities as a result:
  publish, schedule, unpublish, delete and the announcement are reached
  through the post now instead of being menu items of their own.
- **A slug can be renamed without breaking a link.** Renaming (the `[r]`
  action in that dialog) records every old address in the post itself and
  the build keeps a one-page redirect standing at each -- so the URL in
  an old toot keeps resolving. The redirects live and die with the post:
  unpublishing takes them off the site, republishing brings them back.
- **HEIC photos are refused with instructions, or converted on request.**
  The iPhone default renders in Safari and nowhere else, so attaching one
  now stops the save and prints the exact conversion command for the
  machine you are on, leaving the file where it is. Set
  `media.convert_heic: true` and the engine converts it instead, using
  whatever it finds (sips, heif-convert, magick, vips) and falling back to
  the refusal when it finds nothing. Detection is by content, so a HEIC
  smuggled in as `.jpg` is caught too.

### Deploy safety

- **The guards could be switched off permanently, silently.** They
  compared the build against the manifest -- the state of the *target* --
  so every failed upload knocked their reference out of true, and the
  patch for that was a marker that stood them down until a clean run came
  along. When the failure was permanent (a file the host refuses, expired
  credentials, a target that is gone) no clean run ever came, and both
  guards stayed off for good: a build collapsing from 7500 files to a
  handful would have been mirrored, `--prune` included. They now measure
  the build against the last build they accepted, recorded before the
  first byte moves, so there is nothing left to switch off.
- **They also fired when they shouldn't.** 20% of a 32-file build is six
  files, so publishing two posts at once aborted a flow that `./blog.sh`
  runs for you and which cannot pass `--force`. The percentages carry
  absolute floors now.
- **Total bytes are guarded too**, in both directions -- the same file
  count with every page nearly empty was invisible before. A byte drop
  stops the deploy; a byte increase only says so, because attaching media
  is authoring.
- **An empty build is refused.** With an empty manifest as well, it used
  to pass every check.
- **A failing deploy explains itself.** The previous run's outcome is
  reported at the top of the next one, and three unfinished runs in a row
  say so explicitly.

### Fixes

- A re-import minted a **duplicate post** whenever the text behind the
  slug changed at the source -- a fixed typo in an RSS title was enough.
  Matching is on the source id across the whole archive now, updating in
  place and keeping the published slug. Two follow-on holes from that same
  change: a matched post moving across a year boundary could **overwrite a
  different post** that already owned the path, and two feeds with no
  readable channel link could collapse onto one identity and overwrite
  each other.
- An import whose **source died mid-paging** crashed with a raw backtrace
  and no summary, so there was no way to know what had already been
  written.
- **Imported drafts** landed on the live site at a guessable
  `/draft//<slug>/` address, without the token that exists to prevent
  exactly that.
- The interactive picker **could not be given a slug that starts with a
  digit**, and the first keypress silently acted on a different post.
- The pin, the slots and the document type each shipped with a defect
  found by attacking them rather than testing them: a pin did nothing on
  any site with fewer than twenty posts, slots could **double-book across
  a DST change**, and an attachment was **lost on edit** when the repo
  path contained a space. A second pass then found four more that those
  fixes had introduced -- among them an attachment losing its size on the
  first edit and permanently, and `[Handbook](file.pdf "title")` being
  turned into an upload.
- The wizard banner showed the site's description where its own header
  shows a claim, and a bare domain that terminals turned into a punycode
  guess.
- A final review pass, attacking the finished features rather than
  testing them, found a handful more before the release: the properties
  dialog could **revert a post the cron had just published** -- it acted
  on the post it read when the dialog opened, and a scheduled publish in
  between would be undone, its announcement URL dropped, on the next
  keypress (the same guard `edit` already had, now on the dialog's four
  actions too); a re-import **dropped a post's pin and its created_at**,
  which the source has no notion of; a date edit across a year boundary
  left the post's own new address in its redirect list, producing a
  **build warning on every build**; a deploy read a manifest that was
  valid JSON of the wrong shape and **crashed with a raw backtrace**
  instead of the promised "treat it as empty", and a corrupted baseline
  of the wrong shape was swallowed in silence; and a rename to an
  enormous slug failed with a filesystem error rather than a plain
  "too long".

### Worth knowing before upgrading

- **The wizard menu was renumbered.** It lists five activities now, so a
  scripted `printf "4\n" | ./blog.sh` picks a different entry than it did
  in 1.0. The CLI commands are the stable interface and none of them
  changed -- pipe `./blog.sh unpublish <slug>` instead of navigating the
  menu by position.
- **A single file over 100 MB is now refused** -- when a post is saved, so
  you can still do something about it, and again before a deploy sends it.
  One limit for every backend, deliberately, so the site stays portable:
  the strictest supported target (git pages) refuses anything larger, and
  a post that saves today shouldn't become undeployable the day the site
  moves. `--force` does not lift it. Files between 50 MB and 100 MB are
  named but allowed, and one already on the target from before the limit
  is reported rather than refused.
- **A new state file, `.deploy_baseline.json`**, holds what the guards
  measure against. It is gitignored, needs no backup, and losing it costs
  one deploy with the growth guard standing down. A leftover
  `.deploy_manifest*.json.incomplete` from 1.0.1 is read once and removed.

## 1.0.1 -- 2026-08-02

A bug-fix release, from a systematic audit of every flow: authoring,
publishing, both cron jobs, the build, deploy and the importers, asking of
each step what happens if it fails there. Nothing to migrate -- `git pull`,
rebuild, deploy.

### Data that could be lost

- `edit` with a date in another year **destroyed the post**: its JSON was
  deleted before its media moved, and moving into a year with no media
  directory yet raised `ENOENT` in between -- the post survived in neither
  year, was not in `trash/`, and the editor's temp file was already gone.
  The replacement is written before anything is removed now.
- A failed write **truncated the post it was rewriting**. `File.write`
  empties the file first and only then finds out it cannot write, so a full
  disk left a saved post at 0 bytes. Every post write, and the deploy
  manifest, now writes a sibling file and renames it into place.
- A new photo could **overwrite an existing one**: media files are numbered
  per post, but an image kept from a previous save did not consume its
  number, so a second photo of the same type was handed the kept one's name.
- A new post could land on a **leftover media directory**, show its photos,
  and have its own upload deleted from `incoming/` uncopied.
- A source file missing for even a moment made the build drop the copy
  already in `public.nosync/`, and the `--prune` that every publish runs
  then **deleted it from the live site**.

### Flows that could not finish

- The **scheduled-publish cron could wedge permanently**: publishing a post
  with photos into a year nothing had been published into yet raised
  `ENOENT`, took the whole batch with it -- including posts already
  published *and announced* in that run -- and repeated on every tick.
- **One imported post could stop the site from building at all.** Inline
  formatting offsets were counted against the raw HTML text but stored
  against a whitespace-collapsed copy, so ordinary pretty-printed markup
  pushed a span past the end of its text and the build died naming no post.
- **The sidebar refresh never uploaded anything** on a site that does not
  configure all five widgets: the file list was built with `ls`, whose
  non-zero exit under `set -euo pipefail` killed the script one line before
  the upload. Silently, every half hour.
- **An interrupted deploy locked out every later one** -- the partial
  manifest made the file-count guard read the next ordinary deploy as an
  explosion in size, including the deploys the CLI runs itself, which cannot
  pass `--force`.
- **A closed stdin spun at full CPU**: the wait-for-photos loop treated
  end-of-input as "not yet" and re-checked until someone killed the process.
- **One unreadable post file took down the build, `list`, every picker and
  the cron at once**, with a parser error that named no file.

### Correctness

- An edit saved across the cron tick that published the post reverted it to
  a scheduled draft and dropped its announcement URL, so the next tick
  announced it again. Such a save is refused now, with the text kept.
- An ambiguous slug was resolved again at every internal step, so one
  command asked "which year?" two or three times -- and an inconsistent
  answer retargeted it, up to and including deleting the other post.
- GIF and WebP images were silently dropped from every page, caption and
  all, because their dimensions could not be read and that was treated as a
  1x1 tracking pixel. Both are read now, and an image whose size cannot be
  determined renders instead of vanishing.
- An import preview promised more posts and media than the real run wrote; a
  WordPress export with an unusual `post_name` could write an invisible post.
- Feed fetches had no total deadline, so a host that answers slowly forever
  could hold the build and the sidebar cron. 30 seconds now, redirects
  included.
- An emoji-only tag rendered as a link to `/tag//`, which goes nowhere.
- `--force` deploy forgot files pending deletion on the target, which could
  then never be pruned; an unreadable manifest was silently read as "nothing
  was ever uploaded".

### Added

- `./blog.sh version` (also `--version`), the version in the wizard banner
  and in the engine's User-Agent -- which used to be the literal `1.0` and
  would have stayed that way through every later release.
- The backup checklist in [operations](docs/operations.md#backup) now names
  `assets/images/header.png` and `favicon.png`: they are gitignored on
  purpose, so nothing else keeps a copy and a restore would have brought the
  site back with the shipped default artwork.

### Upgrading

`git pull`, then rebuild and deploy. On an existing site the only visible
change is that images the engine could not previously measure now appear --
on the 3280-post archive this was developed against that was exactly one
photo, and old and new engine output differed in 14 files in total.

## 1.0 -- 2026-07-31

The first stable release: a file-based blog engine where posts are JSON
files, the site is a static build, authoring happens in a terminal and
comments live on the Fediverse. No database, no admin server, Ruby stdlib and
bash -- no gems, no npm (one asterisk: the optional Pixelfed/RSS widgets need
`rexml`, a default gem some distributions package separately).

- **Content model** -- one post is one JSON file of typed blocks (text,
  headings, quotes with attribution, lists, task lists, tables, code, chat,
  images, video, audio, links, rules), with inline formatting stored as
  offsets into plain text.
- **Authoring** -- an interactive CLI wizard: `add`, `edit`, `publish`,
  `schedule`, `unpublish`, `delete`/`restore`, `toot`, `rebuild`, `preview`,
  `list`. Drafts deploy to hidden preview URLs with a QR code in the
  terminal; `incoming/` stages photos for writing from a phone over SFTP.
  Degrades to plain prompts in a pipe, respects `NO_COLOR` and `TERM=dumb`.
- **Markdown** -- a deliberate subset, with a cheat sheet generated by the
  parser itself and a section on what is deliberately not supported.
- **Build** -- static HTML via ERB. Tag and type archives, anchored
  pagination, RSS, sitemap, client-side search (phrases, `-exclusion`,
  diacritics-insensitive), memoized rendering that writes only what changed.
- **Comments and announcements** -- each published post announces on Mastodon
  *or* Bluesky; replies are the comments, loaded client-side from the public
  API. `unpublish` deletes the announcement too.
- **Deploy** -- six backends (Surfer, local, rsync, git-pages, rclone, SFTP)
  behind one manifest-driven diff with SHA-256 checksums, `--dry-run`,
  opt-in `--prune`, and shrink/growth guards.
- **Import** -- eight sources (Bluesky, Instagram, Tumblr, Mastodon,
  Pixelfed, Twitter/X, WordPress, RSS/Atom), verified against real archives.
- **i18n** -- English, Czech and German; a language is one YAML file with
  per-key fallback.
- **Appearance** -- a complete theme from seven colour keys per mode, config-
  compiled CSS, banner with corner-scoped scrim, photo grids with lightbox.
- **Security by subtraction** -- CSP meta, self-hosted assets, no third-party
  requests from the engine, `noindex` drafts, escaping everywhere.
