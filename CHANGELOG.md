# Changelog

Every released version, newest first, so a clone can answer "what changed?"
without going to GitHub. Each entry says what was wrong and what it meant in
practice -- a one-line "fixed a bug" is no use to someone deciding whether an
upgrade is urgent for them.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`: a patch release fixes defects and never
changes configuration, content or the shape of a post file; a minor release
adds features and stays compatible with existing sites. `./blog.sh version`
prints what an installation is running.

## 1.0.1 -- 2026-08-02

A bug-fix release, from a systematic audit of every flow: authoring,
publishing, both cron jobs, the build, deploy and the importers, asking of
each step what happens if it fails there. Nothing to migrate -- `git pull`,
rebuild, deploy.

### Data that could be lost

- `edit` with a date in another year **destroyed the post**: its JSON was
  deleted before its media moved, and moving into a year with no media
  directory yet raised `ENOENT` in between -- the post survived in neither
  year, was not in `trash/`, and the editor's temp file was already gone.
  The replacement is written before anything is removed now.
- A failed write **truncated the post it was rewriting**. `File.write`
  empties the file first and only then finds out it cannot write, so a full
  disk left a saved post at 0 bytes. Every post write, and the deploy
  manifest, now writes a sibling file and renames it into place.
- A new photo could **overwrite an existing one**: media files are numbered
  per post, but an image kept from a previous save did not consume its
  number, so a second photo of the same type was handed the kept one's name.
- A new post could land on a **leftover media directory**, show its photos,
  and have its own upload deleted from `incoming/` uncopied.
- A source file missing for even a moment made the build drop the copy
  already in `public.nosync/`, and the `--prune` that every publish runs
  then **deleted it from the live site**.

### Flows that could not finish

- The **scheduled-publish cron could wedge permanently**: publishing a post
  with photos into a year nothing had been published into yet raised
  `ENOENT`, took the whole batch with it -- including posts already
  published *and announced* in that run -- and repeated on every tick.
- **One imported post could stop the site from building at all.** Inline
  formatting offsets were counted against the raw HTML text but stored
  against a whitespace-collapsed copy, so ordinary pretty-printed markup
  pushed a span past the end of its text and the build died naming no post.
- **The sidebar refresh never uploaded anything** on a site that does not
  configure all five widgets: the file list was built with `ls`, whose
  non-zero exit under `set -euo pipefail` killed the script one line before
  the upload. Silently, every half hour.
- **An interrupted deploy locked out every later one** -- the partial
  manifest made the file-count guard read the next ordinary deploy as an
  explosion in size, including the deploys the CLI runs itself, which cannot
  pass `--force`.
- **A closed stdin spun at full CPU**: the wait-for-photos loop treated
  end-of-input as "not yet" and re-checked until someone killed the process.
- **One unreadable post file took down the build, `list`, every picker and
  the cron at once**, with a parser error that named no file.

### Correctness

- An edit saved across the cron tick that published the post reverted it to
  a scheduled draft and dropped its announcement URL, so the next tick
  announced it again. Such a save is refused now, with the text kept.
- An ambiguous slug was resolved again at every internal step, so one
  command asked "which year?" two or three times -- and an inconsistent
  answer retargeted it, up to and including deleting the other post.
- GIF and WebP images were silently dropped from every page, caption and
  all, because their dimensions could not be read and that was treated as a
  1x1 tracking pixel. Both are read now, and an image whose size cannot be
  determined renders instead of vanishing.
- An import preview promised more posts and media than the real run wrote; a
  WordPress export with an unusual `post_name` could write an invisible post.
- Feed fetches had no total deadline, so a host that answers slowly forever
  could hold the build and the sidebar cron. 30 seconds now, redirects
  included.
- An emoji-only tag rendered as a link to `/tag//`, which goes nowhere.
- `--force` deploy forgot files pending deletion on the target, which could
  then never be pruned; an unreadable manifest was silently read as "nothing
  was ever uploaded".

### Added

- `./blog.sh version` (also `--version`), the version in the wizard banner
  and in the engine's User-Agent -- which used to be the literal `1.0` and
  would have stayed that way through every later release.
- The backup checklist in [operations](docs/operations.md#backup) now names
  `assets/images/header.png` and `favicon.png`: they are gitignored on
  purpose, so nothing else keeps a copy and a restore would have brought the
  site back with the shipped default artwork.

### Upgrading

`git pull`, then rebuild and deploy. On an existing site the only visible
change is that images the engine could not previously measure now appear --
on the 3280-post archive this was developed against that was exactly one
photo, and old and new engine output differed in 14 files in total.

## 1.0 -- 2026-07-31

The first stable release: a file-based blog engine where posts are JSON
files, the site is a static build, authoring happens in a terminal and
comments live on the Fediverse. No database, no admin server, Ruby stdlib and
bash -- no gems, no npm (one asterisk: the optional Pixelfed/RSS widgets need
`rexml`, a default gem some distributions package separately).

- **Content model** -- one post is one JSON file of typed blocks (text,
  headings, quotes with attribution, lists, task lists, tables, code, chat,
  images, video, audio, links, rules), with inline formatting stored as
  offsets into plain text.
- **Authoring** -- an interactive CLI wizard: `add`, `edit`, `publish`,
  `schedule`, `unpublish`, `delete`/`restore`, `toot`, `rebuild`, `preview`,
  `list`. Drafts deploy to hidden preview URLs with a QR code in the
  terminal; `incoming/` stages photos for writing from a phone over SFTP.
  Degrades to plain prompts in a pipe, respects `NO_COLOR` and `TERM=dumb`.
- **Markdown** -- a deliberate subset, with a cheat sheet generated by the
  parser itself and a section on what is deliberately not supported.
- **Build** -- static HTML via ERB. Tag and type archives, anchored
  pagination, RSS, sitemap, client-side search (phrases, `-exclusion`,
  diacritics-insensitive), memoized rendering that writes only what changed.
- **Comments and announcements** -- each published post announces on Mastodon
  *or* Bluesky; replies are the comments, loaded client-side from the public
  API. `unpublish` deletes the announcement too.
- **Deploy** -- six backends (Surfer, local, rsync, git-pages, rclone, SFTP)
  behind one manifest-driven diff with SHA-256 checksums, `--dry-run`,
  opt-in `--prune`, and shrink/growth guards.
- **Import** -- eight sources (Bluesky, Instagram, Tumblr, Mastodon,
  Pixelfed, Twitter/X, WordPress, RSS/Atom), verified against real archives.
- **i18n** -- English, Czech and German; a language is one YAML file with
  per-key fallback.
- **Appearance** -- a complete theme from seven colour keys per mode, config-
  compiled CSS, banner with corner-scoped scrim, photo grids with lightbox.
- **Security by subtraction** -- CSP meta, self-hosted assets, no third-party
  requests from the engine, `noindex` drafts, escaping everywhere.
